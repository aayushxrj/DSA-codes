Q. An Italian Cafe offers red sauce and white sauce pasta to its customers, referred to by
numbers 0 and 1 respectively. All the customers stand in a queue. Each customer either prefers
red sauce or white sauce pasta.

The number of pasta dishes in the cafe is equal to the number of customers. The pastas are
placed in a stack. At each step:
If the customer at the front of the queue prefers the pasta on the top of the stack, he/she will
take it and leave the queue. Otherwise, he/she will leave it and go to the queue's end. This
continues until none of the customer wants to take the top pasta and are thus unable to eat.

You are given two integer arrays customers and pastas where pastas[i] is the type of the ith
pasta in the stack and customers[j] is the preference of the jth customer in the initial queue. You
are required to return the number of customers that are unable to eat.


Example 1:

Input: customers = [1,1,0,0], pastas = [0,1,0,1]
Output: 0

Explanation:
• Front customer leaves the top pasta and returns to the end of the line making customers =
[1,0,0,1].
• Front customer leaves the top pasta and returns to the end of the line making customers =
[0,0,1,1].
• Front customer takes the top pasta and leaves the line making customers = [0,1,1] and pastas
= [1,0,1].
• Front customer leaves the top pasta and returns to the end of the line making customers =
[1,1,0].
• Front customer takes the top pasta and leaves the line making customers = [1,0] and pastas
= [0,1].
• Front customer leaves the top pasta and returns to the end of the line making customers =
[0,1].
• Front customer takes the top pasta and leaves the line making customers = [1] and pastas =
[1].
• Front customer takes the top pasta and leaves the line making customers = [] and pastas =
[].
Hence all customers are able to eat.


Example 2:

Input: customers = [1,1,1,0,0,1], pastas = [1,0,0,0,1,1]
Output: 3
